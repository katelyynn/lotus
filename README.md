# lotus

lotus is a repository of capitalisation corrections powering my two last.fm projects, [bleh](https://bleh.katelyn.moe) and [bwaa](https://katelyn.moe/bwaa).

### What is the system?

Last.fm's catalogue of artists, albums, and tracks is powered by people (like you!) scrobbling. The first to scrobble a new entry gets to decide the base capitalisation. While in some cases this can work out, many times this leads to incorrect capitalisations either by mistake or on purpose.

There is an in-built form created by Last.fm to submit corrections but it takes a *long* time - to the point I have stopped sending in new ones as I have never noticed mine take effect. **lotus** aims to be a fix in the middle in the meantime, offering community contributions which are then downloaded in the two previously mentioned projects.

### How do I contribute?

Fill out [the form in the Issues tab](https://github.com/katelyynn/lotus/issues/new/choose) to add your request to the queue. @swiffyjk primarily handles processing the queue and adds many corrections in bulk, so if it's taking too long for you.. have patience. **Pull requests are okay but it's often better to just submit an issue yourself without having to go through the hassle** - it can also create it's own problems like that, so just make an issue using the usual method.

### Do you have any rules?

Unlike music databases like RYM and MusicBrainz, capitalisations are decided by **the artist**, not by strict ruling. If an artist wants their song to be "softscars" or "Take A Bite", **we use that** instead of "Softscars" or "Take a Bite" - even if it's "technically correct" or whatever.

### FAQ
- **What if two artists share the same name?** The most popular usage of the name is favoured, for example in the silly case of [funeral](https://www.last.fm/music/funeral), the top tracks very obviously match the Spotify page of [*this* funeral](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3f0Mhz0oXmnsnehuEGTrfd?si=LpV8APuLRmClhZ5A98JPQQ) (despite the vocal minority who shout about the other *Funeral*). Until Last.fm can separate these pages themselves, I believe this to be the best workaround to appease the majority. In the future, bleh may offer a way to add your own local capitalisation fixes.
- **Where did past requests originate?** Before lotus was created, corrections were hosted in [bleh](https://github.com/katelyynn/bleh/issues?q=label%3Asystem%3Acorrections+is%3Aclosed) - you can find past correction requests here.
